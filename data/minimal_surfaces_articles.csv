Minimal surfaces in S^2xS^2,"Francisco Torralbo, Francisco Urbano",2013-01-08 16:22:24+00:00,"A general study of minimal surfaces of the Riemannian product of two spheres

minimal surfaces of S^2xS^2 and certain pair of minimal surfaces of the sphere

the Riemannian product S^2xR. Some rigidity results for compact minimal

Compactness of conformal Chern-minimal surfaces in Hermitian surface,Xiaowei Xu,2023-09-07 13:50:02+00:00,"The Chern-minimal surfaces in Hermitian surface play a similar role as

prove that any sequence $\{f_n\}$ of conformal Chern-minimal maps from closed
Riemann surface $(\Sigma,\emph{\texttt{j}})$ into a compact Hermitian surface
$(M, J, h)$ with bounded area has a bubble tree limit, which consisting of a

A Correspondence Between Maximal Surfaces and Timelike Minimal Surfaces in $\mathbb{L}^3$,Aryaman Patel,2019-09-17 12:17:19+00:00,"We show that to every maximal surface with conelike singularities in
Lorentz-Minkowski space $\mathbb{L}^3$ that can be locally represented as the
graph of a smooth function, there exists a corresponding timelike minimal
surface in $\mathbb{L}^3$. There exists a linear transformation between such a
maximal surface and its corresponding timelike minimal surface and it maps the
singularities of one to the singularities of the other. Moreover, this
transformation establishes a one-one correspondence between such maximal
surfaces and timelike minimal surfaces and also preserves the one-one property
of the Gauss map. This leads to a Kobayashi type theorem for timelike minimal
surfaces in $\mathbb{L}^3$. Finally, we derive some non-trivial identities

Classification of minimal Lorentz surfaces in indefinite space forms with arbitrary codimension and arbitrary index,Bang-Yen Chen,2013-07-15 14:46:08+00:00,"Since J. L. Lagrange initiated in 1760 the study of minimal surfaces of

space forms are known. Hence, in this paper we investigate minimal Lorentz
surfaces in arbitrary indefinite space forms. As a consequence, we obtain
several classification results for minimal Lorentz surfaces in indefinite space

decompose the height function of a minimal (maximal) surface into finite sums
of height functions of surfaces which, upon change of coordinates, turn out to

The proposed minimal surfaces also have some interesting properties such as
symmetry, containing straight lines and self-intersections. According to the

  In particular, we exhibit a two-parameter family of complete minimal surfaces

surface of C. Costa; these new surfaces are embedded (at least) outside a

$H_1$-surfaces, and the surfaces with spherical mean curvature of harmonic
type, named $H_2$-surfaces. We provide for each these classes a
Weierstrass-type representation depending on three holomorphic functions and we

minimal immersions of a given bordered non-orientable surface to $\mathbb{R}^n$

Runge-Mergelyan type for conformal minimal immersions from non-orientable
surfaces, and show general position theorems for non-orientable conformal

properly embedded non-orientable minimal surface in $\mathbb{R}^4$; a Mobius
strip.
  All our new tools mentioned above apply to non-orientable minimal surfaces

significant new applications to the global theory of non-orientable minimal
surfaces. In particular, we construct proper non-orientable conformal minimal

family $f_h$, for all real $h$, of CMC $h$ surfaces that are tangent to $f$ at

Weierstrass data for a minimal surface, we give an explicit formula for the
generalized Weierstrass data for the non-minimal surfaces $f_h$, and vice
versa. As an application, we use this to give a well-defined dressing action on

Discrete projective minimal surfaces,"A. McCarthy, W. K. Schief",2018-01-25 14:47:51+00:00,"We propose a natural discretisation scheme for classical projective minimal
surfaces. We follow the classical geometric characterisation and classification
of projective minimal surfaces and introduce at each step canonical discrete
models of the associated geometric notions and objects. Thus, we introduce
discrete analogues of classical Lie quadrics and their envelopes and classify
discrete projective minimal surfaces according to the cardinality of the class
of envelopes. This leads to discrete versions of Godeaux-Rozet, Demoulin and
Tzitzeica surfaces. The latter class of surfaces requires the introduction of
certain discrete line congruences which may also be employed in the
classification of discrete projective minimal surfaces. The classification
scheme is based on the notion of discrete surfaces which are in asymptotic
correspondence. In this context, we set down a discrete analogue of a classical
theorem which states that an envelope (of the Lie quadrics) of a surface is in
asymptotic correspondence with the surface if and only if the surface is either
projective minimal or a Q surface. Accordingly, we present a geometric
definition of discrete Q surfaces and their relatives, namely discrete
counterparts of classical semi-Q, complex, doubly Q and doubly complex

Congruence of minimal surfaces,Ognian Kassabov,2014-12-05 20:59:38+00:00,"An interesting problem in classical differential geometry is to find methods
to prove that two surfaces defined by different charts actually coincide up to
position in space. In a previous paper we proposed a method in this direction
for minimal surfaces. Here we explain not only how this method works but also
how we can find the correspondence between the minimal surfaces, if they are
congruent. We show that two families of minimal surfaces which are proved to be
conjugate actually coincide and coincide with their associated surfaces. We
also consider another family of minimal polynomial surfaces of degree 6 and we
apply the method to show that some of them are congruent.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.2130v2,math.DG,"['math.DG', '53A10']"
Bi-quartic parametric polynomial minimal surfaces,"Ognian Kassabov, Krassimira Vlachkova",2015-03-31 18:47:04+00:00,"Minimal surfaces with isothermal parameters admitting B\'{e}zier
representation were studied by Cosin and Monterde. They showed that, up to an
affine transformation, the Enneper surface is the only bi-cubic isothermal
minimal surface. Here we study bi-quartic isothermal minimal surfaces and
establish the general form of their generating functions in the Weierstrass
representation formula. We apply an approach proposed by Ganchev to compute the
normal curvature and show that, in contrast to the bi-cubic case, there is a
variety of bi-quartic isothermal minimal surfaces. Based on the Bezier
representation we establish some geometric properties of the bi-quartic
harmonic surfaces. Numerical experiments are visualized and presented to
illustrate and support our results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.09159v1,math.DG,"['math.DG', '53A10, 65D17']"

Canonical Coordinates and Natural Equations for Minimal Time-like Surfaces in $R^4_2$,"Georgi Ganchev, Krasimir Kanchev",2019-11-29 15:15:33+00:00,"We apply the complex analysis over the double numbers $D$ to study the

free of degenerate points is said to be of general type. We divide the minimal
time-like surfaces of general type into three types and prove that these
surfaces admit special geometric (canonical) parameters. Then the geometry of
the minimal time-like surfaces of general type is determined by the Gauss
curvature $K$ and the curvature of the normal connection $\varkappa$,
satisfying the system of natural equations for these surfaces. We prove the
following: If $(K, \varkappa), \, K^2- \varkappa^2 > 0 $ is a solution to the
system of natural equations, then there exists exactly one minimal time-like
surface of the first type and exactly one minimal time-like surface of the
second type with invariants $(K, \varkappa)$; if $(K, \varkappa),\, K^2-
\varkappa^2 < 0 $ is a solution to the system of natural equations, then there
exists exactly one minimal time-like surface of the third type with invariants
$(K, \varkappa)$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.00014v1,math.DG,"['math.DG', '53A10 (Primary), 53B30 (Secondary)']"

then construct a system of partial differential equations that constrain $M$ to
lift to a minimal surface via the Weierstrauss-Enneper representation demanding
the metric is of the above form. It is concluded that the associated surfaces
connecting the prescribed minimal surface and its conjugate surface satisfy the
system. Moreover, we find a non-trivial symmetry of the PDE which generates a
one parameter family of surfaces isometric to a specified minimal surface. We
