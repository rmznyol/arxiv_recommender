Minimal surfaces in S^2xS^2,"Francisco Torralbo, Francisco Urbano",2013-01-08 16:22:24+00:00,"A general study of minimal surfaces of the Riemannian product of two spheres
S^2xS^2 is tackled. We stablish a local correspondence between (non-complex)
minimal surfaces of S^2xS^2 and certain pair of minimal surfaces of the sphere
S^3. This correspondence also allows us to link minimal surfaces in S^3 and in
the Riemannian product S^2xR. Some rigidity results for compact minimal
surfaces are also obtained.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.1580v1,math.DG,"['math.DG', '53C42 (Primary) 53C40 (Secondary)']"
Compactness of conformal Chern-minimal surfaces in Hermitian surface,Xiaowei Xu,2023-09-07 13:50:02+00:00,"The Chern-minimal surfaces in Hermitian surface play a similar role as
minimal surfaces in K\""ahler surface (see \cite{[PX-21]}) from the viewpoint of
submanifolds. This paper studies the compactness of Chern-minimal surfaces. We
prove that any sequence $\{f_n\}$ of conformal Chern-minimal maps from closed
Riemann surface $(\Sigma,\emph{\texttt{j}})$ into a compact Hermitian surface
$(M, J, h)$ with bounded area has a bubble tree limit, which consisting of a
Chern-minimal map $f_0$ from $\Sigma$ into $M$ and a finite set of
Chern-minimal maps from $S^2$ into $M$. We also show that the limit preserves
area and homotopy class.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.03718v1,math.DG,['math.DG']
Barriers to Topologically Minimal Surfaces,David Bachman,2009-03-10 14:43:54+00:00,"In earlier work we introduced topologically minimal surfaces as the analogue
of geometrically minimal surfaces. Here we strengthen the analogy by showing
that complicated amalgamations act as barriers to low genus, topologically
minimal surfaces.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/0903.1692v1,math.GT,"['math.GT', '57M99']"
Generalized Bernstein Theorem for Stable Minimal Plateau Surfaces,Gaoming Wang,2022-10-20 18:04:52+00:00,"In this paper, we consider a Generalized Bernstein Theorem for a type of
generalized minimal surfaces, namely minimal Plateau surfaces. We show that if
an orientable minimal Plateau surface is stable and has quadratic area growth
in $\mathbb{R}^3 $, then it is flat.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11500v1,math.DG,"['math.DG', '53A10']"
A Correspondence Between Maximal Surfaces and Timelike Minimal Surfaces in $\mathbb{L}^3$,Aryaman Patel,2019-09-17 12:17:19+00:00,"We show that to every maximal surface with conelike singularities in
Lorentz-Minkowski space $\mathbb{L}^3$ that can be locally represented as the
graph of a smooth function, there exists a corresponding timelike minimal
surface in $\mathbb{L}^3$. There exists a linear transformation between such a
maximal surface and its corresponding timelike minimal surface and it maps the
singularities of one to the singularities of the other. Moreover, this
transformation establishes a one-one correspondence between such maximal
surfaces and timelike minimal surfaces and also preserves the one-one property
of the Gauss map. This leads to a Kobayashi type theorem for timelike minimal
surfaces in $\mathbb{L}^3$. Finally, we derive some non-trivial identities
using existing Euler-Ramanujan identities, and some familiar timelike minimal
surfaces in parametric form.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07744v1,math.DG,['math.DG']
Exotic Minimal Surfaces,Francisco J. Lopez,2010-04-15 15:38:54+00:00,"We prove a general fusion theorem for complete orientable minimal surfaces in
$\mathbb{R}^3$ with finite total curvature. As a consequence, complete
orientable minimal surfaces of weak finite total curvature with exotic geometry
are produced. More specifically, universal surfaces (i.e., surfaces from which
all minimal surfaces can be recovered) and space-filling surfaces with
arbitrary genus and no symmetries.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.2656v1,math.DG,"['math.DG', '53A10 (Primary), 49Q05 (Secondary), 49Q10, 53C42']"
Minimal surfaces and the new main inequality,"Vladimir Markovic, Nathaniel Sagman",2022-12-31 16:47:10+00:00,"We establish the new main inequality as a minimizing criterion for minimal
maps to products of $\mathbb{R}$-trees, and the infinitesimal new main
inequality as a stability criterion for minimal maps to $\mathbb{R}^n$. Along
the way, we develop a new perspective on destabilizing minimal surfaces in
$\mathbb{R}^n$, and as a consequence we reprove the instability of some
classical minimal surfaces; for example, the Enneper surface.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00249v2,math.DG,['math.DG']
Ruled minimal surfaces in $\Bbb R^3$ with density $e^z$,"Nguyen Minh Hoang, Doan The Hieu",2009-01-25 15:38:02+00:00,"We classify ruled minimal surfaces in $\Bbb R^3$ with density $e^z.$ It is
showed that there is no noncylindrical ruled minimal surface and there is a
family of cylindrical ruled minimal surfaces in $\Bbb R^3$ with density $e^z.$
It is also proved that all translation minimal surfaces are ruled.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/0901.3904v2,math.DG,"['math.DG', '53C25 (Primary), 53A10 (Secondary), 49Q05']"

properties of minimal surfaces. Here we extend the results of uniformization of

Transforms for minimal surfaces in the 5-sphere,"J. Bolton, L. Vrancken",2005-02-17 09:20:30+00:00,"We define two transforms between minimal surfaces with non-circular ellipse
of curvature in the 5-sphere, and show how this enables us to construct, from
one such surface, a sequence of such surfaces. We also use the transforms to
show how to associate to such a surface a corresponding ruled minimal
Lagrangian submanifold of complex projective 3-space. We illustrate this
explicitly in the case of bipolar minimal surfaces.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0502370v1,math.DG,"['math.DG', '53B25; 53B20']"

Classification of minimal Lorentz surfaces in indefinite space forms with arbitrary codimension and arbitrary index,Bang-Yen Chen,2013-07-15 14:46:08+00:00,"Since J. L. Lagrange initiated in 1760 the study of minimal surfaces of
Euclidean 3-space, minimal surfaces in real space forms have been studied
extensively by many mathematicians during the last two and half centuries. In
contrast, so far very few results on minimal Lorentz surfaces in indefinite
space forms are known. Hence, in this paper we investigate minimal Lorentz
surfaces in arbitrary indefinite space forms. As a consequence, we obtain
several classification results for minimal Lorentz surfaces in indefinite space
forms. In particular, we completely classify all minimal Lorentz surfaces in a
pseudo-Euclidean space $\mathbb E^m_s$ with arbitrary dimension $m$ and
arbitrary index $s$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.3969v1,math.DG,['math.DG']
Minimal Surfaces in the Four-Dimensional Euclidean Space,"Georgi Ganchev, Velichka Milousheva",2008-06-20 07:54:35+00:00,"We prove that the Gauss curvature and the curvature of the normal connection
of any minimal surface in the four dimensional Euclidean space satisfy an
inequality, which generates two classes of minimal surfaces: minimal surfaces
of general type and minimal super-conformal surfaces. We prove a Bonnet-type
theorem for strongly regular minimal surfaces of general type in terms of their
invariants. We introduce canonical parameters on strongly regular minimal
surfaces of general type and prove that any such a surface is determined up to
a motion by two invariant functions satisfying a system of two natural partial
differential equations. On any minimal surface of the basic class of non
strongly regular minimal surfaces we define canonical parameters and prove that
any such a surface is determined up to a motion by two invariant functions of
one variable satisfying a system of two natural ordinary differential
equations. We find a geometric description of this class of non strongly
regular minimal surfaces.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.3334v1,math.DG,"['math.DG', 'math.AP', '53A07; 53A10']"
"Finite Decomposition of Minimal surfaces, Maximal surfaces, Timelike Minimal surfaces and Born-Infeld solitons","Rukmini Dey, Kohinoor Ghosh, Sidharth Soundararajan",2020-10-09 07:26:24+00:00,"We show that the height function of Scherk's second surface decomposes into a
finite sum of scaled and translated versions of itself, using an Euler
Ramanujan identity. A similar result appears in R. Kamien's work on liquid
crystals where he shows (using an Euler-Ramanujan identity) that the Scherk's
first surface decomposes into a finite sum of scaled and translated versions of
itself. We give another finite decomposition of the height function of the
Scherk's first surface in terms of translated helicoids and scaled and
translated Scherk's first surface. We give some more examples, for instance a
(complex) maximal surface and a (complex) BI soliton. We then show, using the
Weierstrass-Enneper representation of minimal (maximal) surfaces, that one can
decompose the height function of a minimal (maximal) surface into finite sums
of height functions of surfaces which, upon change of coordinates, turn out to
be minimal (maximal) surfaces, each minimal (maximal) w.r.t. to its own new
coordinates. We then exhibit a general property of minimal surfaces, maximal
surfaces, timelike minimal surfaces and Born-Infeld soliton surfaces that their
local height functions $z=Z(x,y)$ split into finite sum of scaled and
translated versions of functions of the same form. Upto scaling these new
functions are height functions of the minimal surfaces, maximal surfaces,
timelike minimal surfaces and Born-Infeld soliton surfaces respectively.
Lastly, we exhibit a foliation of ${\mathbb R}^3$ minus certain lines by
shifted helicoids (which appear in one of the Euler-Ramanujan identities).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.04405v3,math.DG,"['math.DG', 'cond-mat.soft']"

Harmonic parametrization of surfaces of arbitrary genus,Peter Connor,2016-02-17 01:44:11+00:00,"The Weierstrass representation for minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$
provides a flexible method for constructing minimal surfaces of arbitrary
genus. The topological limitations of minimal surfaces interfere with this
providing a more general geometric modeling tool. Minimal surfaces lie in the
larger class of harmonic surfaces, which in general don't have the same
topological limitations of minimal surfaces and can have complicated embedded
ends. In this paper we demonstrate the flexibility of using the Weierstrass
representation for harmonic surfaces to combine embedded harmonic ends together
to construct embedded harmonic surfaces of arbitrary genus.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.05265v2,math.DG,"['math.DG', '53A10, 49Q05, 53C42']"

lift to minimal surfaces via the Weierstrass-Enneper representation theorem, we
give necessary and sufficient conditions for $f_3=(1-s)f_1+sf_2$ to lift to a
minimal surface for $s\in[0,1]$. We then construct such mappings from Enneper's
