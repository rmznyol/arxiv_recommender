# Welcome to arXiv recommender system project

### Main Suggestions and TODOs:
- Follow the 'dev' branch until finalized
- Use black to reformat files before updating
- Stick to Modular programming as much as possible (every 'function' should have a script and class if necessary)
- also add Learning Branch

### How to fetch article data:
1. Clone this repo
2. install requirements
3. run '$python abstractFetcher.py', which will ask for your query and how many articles you wish to save. (searched by relevance)
